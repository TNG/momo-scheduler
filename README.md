Momo is a light-weight, easy-to-use scheduler that persists jobs in a MongoDB and supports interval-based scheduling as
well as cron jobs. In essence, it provides an easy way to tell your application to either "run that job every five
minutes" or "run that job at 9 AM every weekday".

## Features

- allows concurrent jobs
- allows immediate jobs
- supports long-running jobs
- allows error handling
- supports cluster mode (e.g. several instances using the same job database)
    - only one schedule per name will attempt to schedule jobs
    - if an active schedule stops running (e.g. the application instance was stopped), another schedule with the same
      name (e.g. running on a different instance) will take over

## Installation

Install via npm:

```
npm install @tngtech/momo-scheduler
```

or yarn:

```
yarn add @tngtech/momo-scheduler
```

You're all set!

## Usage

```typescript
import { MongoSchedule, MomoJob, MomoJobBuilder, MomoErrorEvent, MomoEvent } from 'momo-scheduler';
import { MongoMemoryServer } from 'mongodb-memory-server';
import { MongoScheduleBuilder } from './MongoScheduleBuilder';

const mongo = await MongoMemoryServer.create();
const mongoSchedule = await new MongoScheduleBuilder()
  .withConnection({
    url: mongo.getUri(),
    collectionsPrefix: 'momo',
    scheduleName: 'MySchedule',
    pingIntervalMs: 10_000,
  })
  .build();

const intervalJob: MomoJob = new MomoJobBuilder()
  .withName('interval job')
  .withConcurrency(2)
  .withMaxRunning(3)
  .withSchedule('5 seconds')
  .withParameters({ foo: 'bar' })
  .withHandler(() => console.log('This is a momo job that runs twice every five seconds!'))
  .build();
await mongoSchedule.define(intervalJob);

const cronJob: MomoJob = new MomoJobBuilder()
  .withName('cron job')
  .withConcurrency(1)
  .withMaxRunning(1)
  .withCronSchedule('0 0 * * 1-5')
  .withParameters({ foo: { bar: 'baz' } })
  .withHandler(() => console.log('This is a momo job that runs every weekday at midnight!'))
  .build();
await mongoSchedule.define(cronJob);

const cronJobWithoutParameters: MomoJob = new MomoJobBuilder()
  .withName('cron job without parameters')
  .withConcurrency(1)
  .withMaxRunning(3)
  .withCronSchedule('0 0 * * 1-3')
  .withHandler(() => console.log('This is a momo job that runs on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday!'))
  .build();
await mongoSchedule.define(cronJobWithoutParameters);

// optional: listen to error and debug events
mongoSchedule.on('error', (error: MomoErrorEvent) => {
  /* handle error */
});
mongoSchedule.on('debug', (debug: MomoEvent) => {
  /* ... */
});

await mongoSchedule.start();

// all your application code...

// gracefully disconnect the scheduler
await mongoSchedule.disconnect();
```

### MomoJob

You can instantiate a momo job using the `MomoJobBuilder` class. It provides the following setter methods:

| setter           | parameter                                                                      | mandatory | default value | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Specifies the schedule for starting the job. Time intervals can be given in human-readable formats (like '1 minute', 'ten days', 'twenty-one days and 2 hours' or 'never') or in milliseconds. Check the documentation of [ human-interval ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/human-interval) for details. A job with interval 'never' will not be started to run periodically but needs to be run explicitly. If the DB holds no record of a job with the same name running before, the job will run after `firstRunAfter` for the first time. Just like the `interval`, `firstRunAfter` can also be given in a human-readable format or as milliseconds. The maximum value for both `interval` and `firstRunAfter` is 2147483647 ms (or its human readable equivalents). On jobs with interval 'never', any value passed for `firstRunAfter` is ignored. |

Specifies the cron schedule according to which the job will run.

### MongoSchedule

You can instantiate a mongo schedule using the `MongoScheduleBuilder` class. It provides the following setter
methods:

| setter         | parameter              | mandatory | default value | description                             |
|----------------|------------------------|-----------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| withJob        | `job: MomoJob`         | yes       |               | Adds a job to the schedule.             |
| withConnection | `options: MomoOptions` | yes       |               | The connection options of the schedule. |

The schedule offers the following methods to create and run jobs:

| function   | parameters                                                                                         | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The job descriptions returned by the `list` and `get` functions of the `MongoSchedule` consist of some properties of the
MomoJob (see above) as stored in the database, namely the name, the schedule (human-readable or cron), the concurrency
and maxRunning and the parameters (if any). If the job was already started, it also contains the `schedulerStatus`,
which reports the number of currently `running` executions of the job and the `schedule` the job was started with. This
might differ from the top-level schedule as running jobs do not automatically pick up changes to the schedule from the
database.

After twice the amount of time has elapsed without a ping of your Momo instance, other instances may take over. You might want to reduce this if you have jobs running on short intervals. |
| mongoClientOptions | `MongoClientOptions` | no        |           | Options for the connection to the MongoDB client as specified by the MongoDB API. Useful for providing configuration options that are not available via the connection string (url).                                                                      |

### Reacting to events

The MongoSchedule is an EventEmitter, emitting `'debug'` and `'error'` events.
You can define callbacks to handle them:

```typescript
mongoSchedule.on('error', ({ error, data, message, type }: MomoErrorEvent) => {
  console.log(`An error of type ${type} occurred`, { error, data, message });
});

mongoSchedule.on('debug', ({ data, message }: MomoEvent) => {
  console.log('A debug event occurred', { data, message });
});
```

### Job Examples

```typescript
import { MomoJobBuilder } from './MomoJobBuilder';

const example1 = new MomoJobBuilder()
  .withName('example 1')
  .withInterval('5 minutes')
  .withHandler(() => console.log('This is momo'))
  .build();

const example2 = new MomoJobBuilder()
  .withName('example 2')
  .withInterval('5 minutes', 60 * 1000) // first run after one minute
  .withHandler(() => console.log('This is momo'))
  .build();

const example3 = new MomoJobBuilder()
  .withName('example 3')
  .withInterval('5 minutes', '4 minutes') // first run after four minutes
  .withHandler(() => console.log('This is momo'))
  .build();

const example4 = new MomoJobBuilder()
  .withName('example 4')
  .withCronSchedule('0 0 * * 1-5') // every weekday at midnight
  .withHandler(() => console.log('This is momo'))
  .build();
```

Assume it is 12:00 AM when the MongoSchedule with these four example jobs is started.

- `example 1` will be run immediately, at 12:00, and then every five minutes. Adding `firstRunAfter: 0` explicitly is
  equivalent as this is the default value.
- `example 2` will be run after 1 minute (the configured `firstRunAfter`), at 12:01, and then every five minutes (next
  is 12:06).
- `example 3` will be run after 4 minutes (the configured `firstRunAfter`), at 12:04, and then every five minutes (next
  is 12:09).
- `example 4` will be run at midnight every weekday

Now assume the MongoSchedule is stopped at 12:02 and then immediately started again.

- `example 1` will be run 5 minutes (the configured `interval`) after the last execution, at 12:05. The job is NOT run
  immediately because it already ran before.
- `example 2` will be run 5 minutes (the configured `interval`) after the last execution, at 12:06. The job is NOT run
  after 1 minute (the configured `firstRunAfter`) because it already ran before.
- `example 3` will be run 4 minutes after the start (because of the configured `firstRunAfter`), at 12:06, because it
  never ran before, and then every five minutes (next is 12:11).
- `example 4` will be run at midnight every weekday

If your application is not running while a cron job should start, the missed run will not be started when your
application resumes. This is the case for interval jobs, though - if the time of the next run has already elapsed after
the application restarted, the job will be run immediately.

The benefit of cron jobs is that you can control the exact time of execution. They are also not
restricted to a constant interval.
